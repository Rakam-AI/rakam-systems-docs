🚀 Rakam Systems — AI Systems Lifecycle Framework

From architecture to deployment — one unified toolkit to design, build, evaluate, deploy, and monitor AI systems.

Rakam Systems is an end-to-end Python framework that provides production-ready templates, SDKs, CLIs, and automation for building full AI systems—not just models or agents.

Focus on what matters: your system logic and your business needs.
Rakam Systems provides everything else: architecture scaffolds, evaluation pipelines, data collection templates, model development tooling, deployment-ready microservices, and integrated observability.

⚡️ Build AI Systems End-to-End

🧩 Design → 📊 Evaluate → 📥 Collect → 🧪 Develop → 🚀 Serve → 📦 Deploy → 🔎 Manage

All in a single library.

✨ Key Pillars
| Stage | What Rakam Systems Automates |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Design your Systems** | Architecture templates, diagram generation, SDK-first system definitions |
| **Evaluate your Systems** | Dataset builders, metric definitions, evaluation pipelines |
| **Collect your Data** | Auto-generated CSVs/templates based on evaluation requirements |
| **Develop your Systems** | Reusable components, model wrappers, orchestration patterns |
| **Serve your Systems** | FastAPI microservices, Docker templates, vector DB connectors |
| **Deploy your Systems** | IaC provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, environment automation |
| **Manage your Systems** | Monitoring, drift detection, observability dashboards |

# 🧩 System Lifecycle Overview

Rakam Systems implements a holistic **AI Systems Lifecycle**, enabling a seamless path from design to production.

---

## 1. 🧩 Design your Systems

Create a clear, reproducible architecture:

- Define system components using the **Architecture SDK**
- Sync with **Draw.io** using exported files
- Generate architecture diagrams programmatically

---

## 2. 📊 Evaluate your Systems

Build measurable, reliable AI:

- Define metrics
- Build evaluation datasets
- Structure evaluation scenarios
- Run evaluation pipelines with a single command

---

## 3. 📥 Collect your Data

Your evaluation items become data templates:

- Auto-generate CSVs and annotation formats
- Pre-fill metadata
- Validate incoming data

---

## 4. 🧪 Develop your Systems

Use Rakam Systems' component library or create your own:

- Pre-built modules for ranking, routing, LLM orchestration
- Reusable patterns for ML pipelines
- Model development utilities

---

## 5. 🚀 Serve your Systems

Out-of-the-box microservices:

- FastAPI templates with auth, rate limiting, tracing
- Optional UI playground
- Dockerized services with env-based configuration

---

## 6. 📦 Deploy your Systems

Provision infrastructure and CI/CD using the CLI:

- Deploy to cloud environments
- Terraform integration
- Automatic pipelines for testing, building, and releasing

---

## 7. 🔎 Manage your Systems

Keep your system reliable after launch:

- Monitoring dashboards
- Latency and performance metrics
- Data drift and quality checks
- Alerts & logs automatically integrated
